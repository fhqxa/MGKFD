# Hierarchical Few-shot Learning via Multi-granularity Global-local Feature Cross-measure Mechanism

PyTorch implementation of 

**HGLCM achieves new state-of-the-art performance on five few-shot learning benchmarks with significant advantages. The result is obtained without using any extra data for training or testing (tranductive setting).**
